# Introduction
`grib2io-interp` is the spatial interpolation component for [grib2io](https://github.com/NOAA-MDL/grib2io).  This package provides a Python interface to the [NCEPLIBS-ip](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS-ip) Fortran Library and contains a single NumPy/F2PY extension module.  Originally, it was a part of the grib2io package, but since it requires NumPy's distutil's `Extension` and `setup` to build and install, it needs to be handled separately from the other grib2io source that are using `setuptools`.  This package contains an extension module, `interpolate`, that provides interfaces to Fortran subroutines and these subroutines serve as wrappers to NCEPLIBS-ip subroutines.  The following table illustrates the mapping:

| grib2io-interp | NCEPLIBS-ip |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| interpolate.interpolate_scalar | ipolates_grib2 |
| interpolate.interpolate_vector | ipolatev_grib2 |

**NOTE:** It is recommended that you use [`grib2io.interpolate`](https://noaa-mdl.github.io/grib2io/grib2io.html#interpolate) function to access the interpolation subroutines provided by grib2io-interp.

## Documentation
[NOAA-MDL/grib2io-interp](https://noaa-mdl.github.io/grib2io-interp/grib2io-interp.html)

## Required Software

Despite this package being a component for grib2io, grib2io is not a formal dependency for grib2io-interp.

* [Python](https://python.org) 3.8+
* [NCEPLIBS-sp](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS-sp) 2.4.0+
* [NCEPLIBS-ip](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS-ip) 4.1.0+
* setuptools 61.0+
* NumPy 1.22+
* Fortran Compiler: GNU (gfortran) and Intel (ifort) been tested.

## NCEPLIBS Libraries

### sp and ip
The NCEP Spectral Interpolation [(NCEPLIBS-sp)](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS-sp) library is a dependency for the NCEP Interpolation [(NCEPLIBS-ip)](https://github.om/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS-ip) library.  Both of these libraries are Fortran-based and contains OpenMP directives.

## Installation
If NCEPLIBS-sp, and NCEPLIBS-ip libraries have been installed to custom locations (i.e. not default paths), then define the root of these installations via environment variables `SP_DIR`, and `IP_DIR`, respectively.
```shell
pip install grib2io-interp
```

## Build and Install from Source

* Clone GitHub repository or download a source release from [GitHub](https://github.com/NOAA-MDL/grib2io-interp) or [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/grib2io-interp).

* Edit `setup.cfg` to define the sp, and ip library installation paths __OR__ define `SP_DIR` and `IP_DIR` environment variables.

* Build and install.  Use `--user` to install into personal space (`$HOME/.local`).

```shell
pip install .
```
To build with Intel compilers, perform the following
```shell
pip install . --config-settings="--build-option=build --fcompiler=intelem"
```
